# Phase 1 Outcomes — Embedded App Chat Widget

## Status
Completed and validated in local development.

## What Was Done
- Added floating assistant button inside embedded app routes.
- Added slide-in chat sidebar UI.
- Added mock chat endpoint at `POST /api/chat`.
- Wired widget into app layout route.

## Changed Files
- `frontend/app/components/ChatWidget/FloatingButton.tsx`
- `frontend/app/components/ChatWidget/ChatSidebar.tsx`
- `frontend/app/components/ChatWidget/index.tsx`
- `frontend/app/routes/api.chat.tsx`
- `frontend/app/routes/app.tsx`

## Why It Was Done This Way
- This gives immediate UX feedback and lets product/design iterate on assistant behavior before backend AI is ready.
- Keeping the endpoint mocked decouples UI work from AI orchestration complexity.
- Implementing inside embedded app (`/app/*`) avoids Shopify admin-surface constraints while proving core interaction first.

## Verified Behavior
- Floating button appears on embedded app pages.
- Sidebar opens and closes reliably.
- User message is appended instantly.
- Mock assistant reply is appended after request completion.

## Known Gaps
- No real AI backend integration yet.
- No persistence of conversation history.
- No streaming token response.

## Phase 1 Exit Result
Phase 1 objective was met: embedded assistant interaction is functional and testable.
